          <p>
            War is a classic card game with simple rules. WarPlus has the added benefit of multi-player functionality and a personal dashboard to store your games. This page will teach you more about how to play the game and how to access the features of our app. We hope you enjoy WarPlus!

            <h4 class="demo">How to Play</h4>
            <p>
              Players shuffle and divide the deck of cards equal ways amongst all players. Each player draws a card from their pile to reveal their top card. The player with the highest value card drawn gets to keep all the cards that were just played. 

              If a player should draw a card with the same value as another player, they go to war to settle the dispute of who should get the cards. In WarPlus, it compares the very next card in each war participant's pile to determine the winner of all the cards in the pot. If a war situation happens again with the second draw, a third card is drawn and so on until a winner is declared.

              This process is repeated until one player has all of the cards in their pile.
              <br />
              <b>NOTE: Various versions of War have different rules, so keep in mind our version may be slightly different than others:</b>
              <ul class="demo-list">
                <li>Our version considers Aces low (value of 1).</li>
                <li>Our version only draws one card after a war is declared</li>
              </ul>

            <p>
              Creating and accessing your WarPlus account is quick and easy. When you first sign up, simply fill in the form. You will need a properly formatted email to sign up. Upon successfully signing up, you will be brought to your dashboard, where you will be able to add a new game to start playing.

              If you already have an account, click on the option to 'Sign In' and fill in your account credentials. Once you are logged in, it will take you directly to your dashboard, where you can either pick up an ongoing game or create a new one.

            <h4 class="demo">How to Start a Game</h4>
            <p>
              To start a game you will need to be logged in. Once logged in, you will see a button to add a new game. When you click that button, a modal will pop up with options. Choose the number of players you'd like for this game. If you choose 1 play, you will be automatically matched up with our AI. 
              
              If you choose 2 or more players, an invite link will be populated. Copy the link and share it with the other players. Once they create a WarPlus account and paste the link in their address bar, they should see a game loaded in their dashboard. As soon as they click the game button, you're ready to play head to head!

            <h4 class="demo">How to Take Turns</h4>
            <p>
              Each player will have a 'Ready' button under their name (or the name they used when they signed up). When it is your turn, you will click the ready button to end your turn. In a multi-player game, your button will say 'Waiting' if it is another player's turn and they have not yet hit their ready button.
